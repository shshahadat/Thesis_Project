Title: Enhanced Brain Tumor Classification with Integrated Deep Learning and Classical Machine Learning Techniques


In the realm of medical diagnosis and treatment planning, accurate identification and classification of brain tumors are paramount. Our study introduces a comprehensive methodology to bolster the accuracy of brain tumor detection by integrating diverse computational techniques. We leverage a multifaceted dataset comprising three distinct brain tumor types along with a class representing the absence of a tumor.Our approach begins with meticulous image preprocessing, employing Gaussian, Unsharp Mask, and Laplacian filters to enhance image quality and accentuate critical features. Subsequently, we undertake feature extraction using a blend of pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models - ResNet50, VGG19, and MobileNetV2 - coupled with a custom-designed CNN architecture adept at capturing intricate image representations.The extracted features are then fed into classical classifiers: Random Forest, AdaBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By amalgamating deep learning and classical machine learning techniques, we aim to exploit the complementary strengths of each approach to achieve superior classification accuracy.Experimental results on a multi-class brain tumor dataset underscore the effectiveness of our methodology, yielding a remarkable classification accuracy of 97.1%. This notable achievement underscores the potential of our approach in accurately identifying and categorizing brain tumor types, thereby facilitating more informed medical decisions and treatments.Our study represents a significant contribution to the ongoing quest for leveraging advanced computational techniques to enhance medical image analysis and diagnosis, promising far-reaching implications in the field of healthcare.
